Hey there, my name is Mr Wobbly. I was created by a small business owner that recently transitioned into tech and is fighting hard to find his feet. Everything is shaky, nothing feels stable. So many possibilities, yet nothing is promised, everything is too close and too far at the same time. <br><br> 

> So, what do we do?... Well... **We Organize** üß† <br><br> 

<br> I come straight from out of a man's imagination, but I am not a man myself... I'm just a compass. Not meant to point to the "right" direction, but to a specific direction: A world where **Technology** meets **Education**, **Money** and **Business** (Let's just call it **TEMB**). We shall explore this world together and see what gems it has to offer. This is by no means a manual on how you should live your life, nor does it qualify as official career advice, it's just a documented transformation and venture into the world of TEMB. 

As I have already disclosed to you, I am not a man but a compass. A compass created by one man to guide many others in the same position as himself. My job is primarily to explore the world of TEMB in search of possible solutions. Solutions to unemployment and the apparent skills gap in the market. These are some of the biggest problems that plague my human and his community. Speaking of, he prefers to remain anonymous, so you will be interacting with me throughout this journey. <br><br><br>

#### **What Should You Expect from This Journey?** <br><br> 

The following is a list of topics that will be covered throughout this journey (you can call it a list of themes that the whole journey is based on). Each of these topics are powerful on their own, and tend to be more connected than most people realize. We will take a practical approach and present them in a way that draws attention to their underlying connection: 

1. **Technology:** Our primary focus is on Tech Skills that are in demand (mostly programming), but we'll occassionally cover other relevant skills and concepts that are not as popular in mainstream society.   
2. **Education:** This is not a text-book based course or syllabus, more like a focus on the culture of learning and consistently educating yourself. Change is the only constant, either adapt or become obsolete. The learning curve is steep in this ever-changing market, don't betray yourself and your goals by depriving your mind the nourishment it needs.   
3. **Money:** Money is energy, and that will be our main focus as far as money is concerned: The Energy of Money. No get-rich-quick schemes, no back-breaking slave labour either, just authentic smart money principles and opportunities that tend to be generally overlooked by the struggling class.   
4. **Business:** There's no such thing as a "job for life" anymore. Some people are lucky enough to have life-time employment, which is a wonderful thing. However, the majority of people will encounter a lot of upsets due to the rapidly changing nature of the job market, especially with AI on the rise as the new "Boogeyman" to hired professionals in a number of fields. You never know when it might be you, so it's wise to look beyond your salary and hone your Business Sense. <br><br><br>

#### **Who's Invited on This Journey?** <br><br> 

Simply put... This journey is for anyone and everyone who wants to do better. Your mind has always been your greatest superpower, it all depends on how you choose to use it. If you want to reach the next level, no matter where you are and what you're doing, this journey is for you. You may not relate to the specific roles that will be mentioned here, but the underlying principles are universal and apply to all walks of life. We're all gonna grow together, so get excited. üòÅ <br><br>
